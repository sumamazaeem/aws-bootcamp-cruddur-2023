# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

In the last week, I did Architectural Diagrams, installed the CLI and setup alarm budgets.
Now, I startes using the gitpod which is quite helpful. I created another branch by the name, sumama-zaeem-patch-week-1 and would merge it when I successfully complete week1 tasks.
I learnt the benefits of containerization
Learnt about the DockerHub which is a container registery for images. I also learnt about the OCI and also about linuxserver.io and jfrog
In this week task, i will be containerize the backend and will be creating a docker file
